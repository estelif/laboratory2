   In this code each data structure serves a specific purpose and provides methods for effectively manipulating and managing data.
If we provide each class, we can see the way of usage of every implementations. For instance, in my code i've used classes and methods as,

  **MyArrayList** -> Implements a dynamic array-based list with functions for insertion, modification, retrieval, and deletion of elements. 
It also supports resizing, inserting elements at specific indices, and clearing the list.

   **MyLinkedList** -> Represents a doubly linked list providing operations for element manipulation, size determination, and clearing.  
	 
   **MyStack** -> Constructs a stack with push, pop, top, isEmpty, and clear operations.
   
   **MyQueue** -> Implements a queue with enqueue, dequeue, front, back, size, isEmpty, and clear functions.
   
   **MyMinHeap** -> Represents a minimum heap structure supporting insertion, extraction of the minimum element, accessing the minimum without removal, and clearing the heap. 
It includes internal functions like heapify to maintain its properties.
